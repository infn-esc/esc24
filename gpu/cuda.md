The CUDA Runtime API reference manual is a very useful source of information:
<a href="http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-runtime-api/index.html" target="_blank">http://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-runtime-api/index.html</a>

If you haven't already done it, load the CUDA module

```shell
$ module load compilers/cuda-12.1

```

Check that your environment is correctly configured to compile CUDA code by running:
```bash
$ nvcc --version
nvcc: NVIDIA (R) Cuda compiler driver
Copyright (c) 2005-2023 NVIDIA Corporation
Built on Mon_Apr__3_17:16:06_PDT_2023
Cuda compilation tools, release 12.1, V12.1.105
Build cuda_12.1.r12.1/compiler.32688072_0
```

Compile and run the `deviceQuery` application:
```bash
$ cd hands-on/cuda/utils/deviceQuery
$ make
```

You can get some useful information about the features and the limits that you will find on the device you will be running your code on. For example:

```shell
$ ./deviceQuery 
./deviceQuery Starting...

Some of you are sharing the same machine and some time measurements can be influenced by other users running at the very same moment. It can be necessary to run time measurements multiple times.

### Exercise 1: CUDA Memory Model

In this exercise you will learn what heterogeneous memory model means, by demonstrating the difference between host and device memory spaces.

1. Allocate device memory;
2. Copy the host array h_a to d_a on the device;
3. Copy the device array d_a to the device array d_b;
4. Copy the device array d_b to the host array h_a;
5. Free the memory allocated for d_a and d_b.
6. Compile and run the program by running:

```bash
$ nvcc cuda_mem_model.cu -o ex01
$ ./ex01
```

7. Repeat the exercise using CUDA Streams with `cudaMallocAsync`, `cudaFreeAsync` and `cudaMemcpyAsync`.
   1. Hint: Remember to check that asynchronous operations have completed before using their results.
8. Measure the interconnection bandwidth between CPU and GPU by measuring the time needed to transfer an array of `100 MB` in size.

### Exercise 2: Launch a kernel

By completing this exercise you will learn how to configure and launch a simple CUDA kernel.

1. Allocate device memory;
2. Configure the kernel to run using a one-dimensional grid of one-dimensional blocks (i.e. using only the `x` coordinate for `blockIdx` and `threadIdx`);
3. Each GPU thread should set one element of the array to:

   `d_a[i] = i + 42;`
4. Copy the results to the host memory;
5. Check the correctness of the results

### Exercise 3: Two-dimensional grid

M is a matrix of NxN integers.

1. Set N=4
2. Write a kernel that sets each element of the matrix to its linearized index (e.g. M[2,3] = 2*N + 3), by making use of two-dimensional grid and blocks. (Two-dimensional means using the x and y coordinates).
3. Copy the result to the host and check that it is correct.
4. Try with a rectangular matrix 19x67.

Hint: check the kernel launch parameters.
Hint: fix the number of threads per block in each dimension and find the number of blocks needed to cover the full matrix. Pay attention not to write or read out of the matrix boundaries.

### Exercise 4: Parallel Reduction

Given an array `a[N]`, the reduction sum `Sum` of a is the sum of all its elements: `Sum=a[0]+a[1]+...a[N-1]`.

1. Implement a block-wise parallel reduction (using the shared memory).
2. For each block, save the partial sum.
3. Sum all the partial sums together.
4. Check the result comparing with the host result.
5. Measure the throughput of your reduction kernel using CUDA Events (see exercise 4)

* Bonus: Can you implement a one-step reduction? Measure and compare the throughput of the two versions.
* Challenge: The cumulative sum of an array `a[N]` is another array `b[N]`, the sum of prefixes of `a`:
`b[i] = a[0] + a[1] + … + a[i]`. Implement a cumulative sum kernel assuming that the size of the input array is multiple of the block size.


### Parallel Challenge: The circle of life

The purpose of this lab is to optimize and accelerate a prey-predator simulation using the parallel paradigms you have learned. The simulation is based on Conway's Game of Life with a twist: the cells are either prey or predators. The prey reproduce and move, while the predators eat the prey and reproduce.

### Atomics <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-c-programming-guide/index.html#atomic-functions" target="_blank">[1]</a>

An atomic function performs a read-modify-write atomic operation on one 32-bit or 64-bit word residing in global or shared memory.
The operation is atomic in the sense that it is guaranteed to be performed without interference from other threads.

```C++
int atomicAdd(int* address, int val);
unsigned int atomicAdd(unsigned int* address,
                       unsigned int val);
unsigned long long int atomicAdd(unsigned long long int* address,
                                 unsigned long long int val);
float atomicAdd(float* address, float val);
double atomicAdd(double* address, double val);
__half2 atomicAdd(__half2 *address, __half2 val);
__half atomicAdd(__half *address, __half val);
```

reads the 16-bit, 32-bit or 64-bit word old located at the address address in global or shared memory, computes (old + val), and stores the result back to memory at the same address. These three operations are performed in one atomic transaction. The function returns old.
